Issues i came up with :
1.
    on InstructorInfoScreen.dart ,
    we first have a custome appbar, then we have a card InfoCard, then we have a ConsultationHourCard
    Now consulationcard contains listView, that means its size is increasing or decreasing according to its content,
    the whole body is inside a Column, which is containing InfoCard and ConsultationHourCard, and this columns is wraped in singleChildScrollView
    *Now the issue when the consultationCard having many items, it is increasing size in vertical Axis,
        when i scroll down to see its contents, and we reached at a point where only the constationCard's Content is visible,
        now when i try to scrollup it is trying to scroll the listView, and i am unable to reach up,
        as now SwipeUp event is catching by listView whereas i want to the SingleChildScrollView (applied on column) to catch the gesture and swipe up.

    The issue is just Resolved by adding following is ListView.
        physics: NeverScrollableScrollPhysics(),
